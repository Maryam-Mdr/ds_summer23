	abstract = {Compared to the past, the complexity of construction-project progress has increased as the size of structures has become larger and taller. This has resulted in many unexpected problems with an increasing frequency of occurrence, such as various uncertainties and risk factors. Recently, research was conducted to solve the problem via integration with data-collection automation tools of construction-project-progress measurement. Most of the methods used spatial sensing technology. Thus, this study performed a review of the representative technologies applied to construction-project-progress data collection and identified the unique characteristics of each technology. The basic principle of the progress proposed in this study is its execution through the point cloud and the attributes of BIM, which were studied in five stages: (1) Acquisition of construction completion data using a point cloud, (2) production of a completed 3D model, (3) interworking of an as-planned BIM model and as-built model, (4) construction progress tracking via overlap of two 3D models, and (5) verification by comparison with actual data. This has confirmed that the technical limitations of the construction progress tracking through the point cloud do not exist, and that a fairly high degree of progress data which contains efficiency and accuracy can be collected.},

	abstract = {The S-shaped curve is typically used to model the diffusion of linguistic change across time. This  paper looks at the degree to which the model applies to empirical real-time data of some time-depth. An S-shaped curve is commonly attested in the quantitative studies discussed, but it is not the only pattern that emerges from systematic  analyses. To put the model and its descriptive adequacy into perspective, I consider  both typical cases and exceptions to them, notably change reversals. I also  draw attention to the level of analytic detail that has a major role to play in empirical research into processes of language change and their outcomes.},

	abstract = {Agile methodologies were introduced in 2001. Since this time, practitioners have applied Agile methodologies to many delivery disciplines. This article explores the application of Agile methodologies and principles to business intelligence delivery and how Agile has changed with the evolution of business intelligence. Business intelligence has evolved because the amount of data generated through the internet and smart devices has grown exponentially altering how organizations and individuals use information. The practice of business intelligence delivery with an Agile methodology has matured; however, business intelligence has evolved altering the use of Agile principles and practices. The Big Data phenomenon, the volume, variety, and velocity of data, has impacted business intelligence and the use of information. New trends such as fast analytics and data science have emerged as part of business intelligence. This paper addresses how Agile principles and practices have evolved with business intelligence, as well as its challenges and future directions.},

In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.},
